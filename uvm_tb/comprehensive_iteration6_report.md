RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
----------------------------------------
丘멆잺  Address test failures and errors before expanding coverage

Coverage Enhancement Recommendations:
1. Add missing instruction types (JUMP, CSR, PULP extensions)
2. Increase diversity in register usage patterns
3. Add more complex hazard scenarios
4. Implement corner case testing for all instruction types
5. Add performance-focused test scenarios

Sequence Design Recommendations:
1. Balance randomization with directed testing
2. Optimize sequence length for better coverage/complexity ratio
3. Add cross-instruction dependencies
4. Implement adaptive stimulus generation
