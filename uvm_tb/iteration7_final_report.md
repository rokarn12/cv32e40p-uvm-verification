COVERAGE GAPS ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

üü° Missing Instruction Types (High)
  Issue: Instruction types not covered: CSR, JUMP, FPU, PULP_ALU, PULP_SIMD
  Recommendation: Add sequences to cover missing instruction types

üü° Runtime Errors (High)
  Issue: cv32e40p_comprehensive_test had 3 UVM_ERROR messages
  Recommendation: Fix runtime errors to ensure valid coverage data

üü° Runtime Errors (High)
  Issue: cv32e40p_basic_test had 3 UVM_ERROR messages
  Recommendation: Fix runtime errors to ensure valid coverage data

TRADEOFFS ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Sequence Design Tradeoffs:

1. Sequence Complexity vs Coverage:
   cv32e40p_comprehensive_test:
     Complexity Score: 10
     Coverage Score: 6
     Efficiency Ratio: 0.60
   cv32e40p_basic_test:
     Complexity Score: 1
     Coverage Score: 4
     Efficiency Ratio: 4.00

2. Randomization vs Directed Testing:
   Random Tests: 2 (Coverage: 10)
   Directed Tests: 0 (Coverage: 0)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
----------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è  Address test failures and errors before expanding coverage

Coverage Enhancement Recommendations:
1. Add missing instruction types (JUMP, CSR, PULP extensions)
2. Increase diversity in register usage patterns
3. Add more complex hazard scenarios
4. Implement corner case testing for all instruction types
5. Add performance-focused test scenarios

Sequence Design Recommendations:
1. Balance randomization with directed testing
2. Optimize sequence length for better coverage/complexity ratio
3. Add cross-instruction dependencies
4. Implement adaptive stimulus generation
